Goode\nHe used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack\nGo sit beneath the tree by the railroad track\nOh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade\nStrumming with the rhythm that the drivers made\nPeople passing by they would stop and say\n\"Oh my what that little country boy could play\"\nGo go\nGo Johnny go go\nGo Johnny go go\nGo Johnny go go\nGo Johnny go go\nJohnny B. Goode\nHis mother told him \"someday you will be a man\nAnd you will be the leader of a big old band\nMany people coming from miles around\nTo hear you play your music when the sun go down\nMaybe someday your name will be in lights\nSaying \"Johnny B.
